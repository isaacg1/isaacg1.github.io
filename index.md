I am currently the [Tennenbaum Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/research/isye-postdoctoral-fellowship-program)
at the Georgia Tech School of Industrial and Systems Engineering,
where I am mentored by [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/).
I just defended my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).
Check out my [thesis document](/assets/isaac-thesis.pdf)
which provides a guided tour of my PhD research,
and is designed to be more approachable than diving into my papers directly.

My name is Isaac Grosof, and I go by Izzy for short. I am nonbinary, and I use they/them pronouns.
Check out my [introduction to my nonbinary gender](/2023/07/06/my-gender) for more info.

I will be a postdoc at Georgia Tech until February 2024, when I am moving to UIUC to do another 6-month postdoc,
this one with [R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/).
In Fall 2024, I will be starting as a professor at Northwestern University,
in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences department.

I research stochastic queueing theory, with a focus on scheduling and resource allocation,
and optimal multiserver policies in particular.
If you are a first-year PhD student at Northwestern, a prospective student, or thinking of applying,
feel free to reach out to me, I am looking to recruit students.

I have received
the [**INFORMS 2022 George Nicholson Award**](publications/#the-gittins-policy-is-nearly-optimal-in-the-mgk-under-extremely-general-conditions), the award for the best student paper in the field of operations research,
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award**](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [**IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
I was a [**2023 Siebel Scholar**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005006/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2023),
a fellowship recognizing academic excellence and leadership.

which I'd be interested in advising a student to work on and/or interested in collaborating on.
