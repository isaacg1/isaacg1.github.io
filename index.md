![Isaac Grosof's portrait](/assets/portrait-small.jpg)

I'm Isaac Grosof, a fifth-year PhD student in CS at CMU,
advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).
I completed my BS and MEng at MIT under [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/).
I work on stochastic scheduling and resource allocation, with a focus on optimal policies.
I received
the [ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
