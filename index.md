I am an [assistant professor](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/grosof-isaac.html) at Northwestern University, in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (IEMS) Department.

I research stochastic queueing theory, with a focus on scheduling and resource allocation,
and optimal multiserver policies in particular.

I am advising two wonderful PhD students:

* [Ziyuan Wang](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#ziyuan-wang)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuan-wang-826178238)).
* [Cameron Curtis](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#cameron-curtis)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-curtis-238071197)),
joint advised with
[Seyed Iravani](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~iravani/).

I am leading an exciting independent study:

* [Heyuan Yao](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#heyuan-yao)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyuan-yao-96695b208)), Spring 2025.

I am advising an excellent undergraduate researcher:

* Jay Kowalik

If you are a first-year PhD student at Northwestern, a prospective student, or thinking of applying,
feel free to reach out to me, I am looking to recruit students with a strong mathematical background.
If you're an undergraduate student at Northwestern interested in doing research,
you should also feel free to get in touch.

My name is Izzy Grosof, where Izzy is short for Isaac. I am nonbinary, and I use both they/them and she/her pronouns.
Check out my [introduction to my nonbinary gender](/2023/07/06/my-gender) for more info on my gender,
my [they/she Q&A](/2024/01/19/they-she) for more info on my pronouns,
or all of my [gender-related posts](gender).

I have received the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2023 Doctoral Dissertation Award**](https://sigmetrics.org/dissertationaward-2023.shtml),
the [**INFORMS 2022 George Nicholson Award**](publications/#the-gittins-policy-is-nearly-optimal-in-the-mgk-under-extremely-general-conditions),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award**](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [**IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
I was the [**2023 Tennenbaum Postdoctoral Fellow**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/research/isye-postdoctoral-fellowship-program) and a [**2023 Siebel Scholar**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005006/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2023).

In 2023-24, I was a postdoc with [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)
at Georgia Tech
and with [R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/)
at UIUC.
I received my PhD from CMU in the summer of 2023, where I was advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).
Check out my [thesis document](/assets/isaac-thesis.pdf)
which provides a guided tour of my PhD research,
and is designed to be more approachable than diving into my papers directly.

Check out my [publications](publications), all of which you can download to read.

Check out my potential [project ideas](project-ideas),
which I'd be interested in advising a student to work on and/or interested in collaborating on.

Check out my [blog](blog).

Here's an archive of my [job market materials](job-market).
