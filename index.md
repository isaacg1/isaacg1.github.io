I have accepted a faculty position at Northwestern University, in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences department. I will start there in Fall 2024. I will be doing a postdoc in the intervening year, at Georgia Tech from August 1 '23 to February 1 '24, and at UIUC from February 1 '24 to August 1 '24.

I work on stochastic scheduling and resource allocation, with a focus on optimal policies.

I have received
the [**INFORMS 2022 George Nicholson Award**](publications/#the-gittins-policy-is-nearly-optimal-in-the-mgk-under-extremely-general-conditions), the award for the best student paper in the field of operations research,
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award**](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [**IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
I am a [**2023 Siebel Scholar**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005006/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2023), a fellowship recognizing academic excellence and leadership.
