I'm Isaac Grosof, a fifth-year computer-science student at CMU.

I am advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).

My research interests include queueing theory, scheduling and performance modeling. I have a particular interest in multiserver scheduling and tail metrics in queueing.

Check out my [publications](publications.md), all of which you can download to read.

Check out my [blog](blog.md).

In the past,
I have researched the complexity theory of abstract motion planning with [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/)
and information theoretic cryptography with [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/).

Here's some art I made:
