I'm Isaac Grosof, a second-year computer science PhD student at CMU.

I am advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).

My research is in queueing theory, scheduling, ad performance modeling. I am particularly interested in scheduling for multiserver systems, and tail metrics in queueing.
