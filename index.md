**[IEMS 315 Resources](resources-315)**

![Izzy Grosof's portrait - A nonbinary person with their head and shoulders visible, wearing a white scoop-necked top with large purple flowers.](/assets/website-photo.jpg)

I am an [assistant professor](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/grosof-isaac.html) at Northwestern University,
in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (IEMS) Department.
I also have a courtesy position in the NU Computer Science (CS) Department.

I research stochastic queueing theory, with a focus on scheduling and resource allocation,
and optimal multiserver policies in particular.

I am advising three wonderful PhD students:

* [Ziyuan Wang](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#ziyuan-wang)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuan-wang-826178238)).
* [Cameron Curtis](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#cameron-curtis)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-curtis-238071197)),
joint advised with
[Seyed Iravani](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~iravani/).
* [Heyuan Yao](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/people/graduate-students/#heyuan-yao)
([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyuan-yao-96695b208)).

I am advising two excellent undergraduate/master's researchers:

* Yanis Zain
* Bryan Yuen ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanyuen04/))

Past advisees include:

* Jay Kowalik (Undergrad, ~Spring 2025)

If you are a first-year PhD student at Northwestern, a prospective student, or thinking of applying,
feel free to reach out to me, I am looking to recruit students with a strong mathematical background.
If you're an undergraduate student at Northwestern interested in doing research,
you should also feel free to get in touch.

My name is Izzy Grosof, where Izzy is short for Isaac. I am nonbinary, and I use both they/them and she/her pronouns.
Check out my [introduction to my nonbinary gender](/2023/07/06/my-gender) for more info on my gender,
my [they/she Q&A](/2024/01/19/they-she) for more info on my pronouns,
or all of my [gender-related posts](gender).

Teaching:
* [IEMS 315](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/academics/courses/descriptions/315.html): Stochastic Models.
Mostly undergraduate course, mostly juniors and seniors.
Covers modeling with Markov chains and Poisson processes, and a bit of queueing theory.
Taught fall 2024, returning fall 2025!
* [IEMS 460-1](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/academics/courses/descriptions/460-1.html): Stochastic Processes 1.
Mostly graduate class, mostly first-year PhD students.
A mathematically rigorous look at Markov chains and Poisson processes, and a bit of queueing theory.
Taught winter 2025, returning winter 2026!
* [IEMS 464](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/academics/courses/descriptions/keep/464.html): Advanced Queueing Theory.
Mostly graduate class, mix of years of PhD students.
Exploring a variety of topics in queueing theory, from classical results to recent developments!
More details to come as I decide what to put in the class.
Coming winter 2026!


I have received
the [**2025 Cole-Higgins Award for Excellence in Teaching from the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2025/09/northwestern-engineering-names-winners-of-2025-cole-higgins-awards/),
the **2025 INFORMS Graduate Teaching Award from the IEMS Department at Northwestern**,
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2023 Doctoral Dissertation Award**](https://sigmetrics.org/dissertationaward-2023.shtml),
the [**INFORMS 2022 George Nicholson Award**](publications/#the-gittins-policy-is-nearly-optimal-in-the-mgk-under-extremely-general-conditions),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award**](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [**IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
I was the [**2023 Tennenbaum Postdoctoral Fellow**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/research/isye-postdoctoral-fellowship-program) and a [**2023 Siebel Scholar**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005006/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2023).

In 2023-24, I was a postdoc with [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/)
at Georgia Tech
and with [R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/)
at UIUC.
I received my PhD from CMU in the summer of 2023, where I was advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).
Check out my [thesis document](/assets/isaac-thesis.pdf)
which provides a guided tour of my PhD research,
and is designed to be more approachable than diving into my papers directly.

Check out my [publications](publications), all of which you can download to read.

Check out my potential [project ideas](project-ideas),
which I'd be interested in advising a student to work on and/or interested in collaborating on.
