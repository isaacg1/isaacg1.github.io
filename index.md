**I am presenting a tutorial at SIGMETRICS 2024 on June 10th. Click to download the [slides](/assets/mams-tutorial.pptx) ([pdf](/assets/mams-tutorial.pdf)) and the [worksheet](/assets/mams-worksheet.pdf), if you prefer an electronic copy to a physical copy.**

I am currently a [Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/researchers/igrosof)
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
where I am mentored by [R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/).
In fall 2023, I was a postdoc at the Georgia Tech School of Industrial and Systems Engineering,
where I was mentored by [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/).
In the summer of 2023, I defended my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).
Check out my [thesis document](/assets/isaac-thesis.pdf)
which provides a guided tour of my PhD research,
and is designed to be more approachable than diving into my papers directly.

My name is Izzy Grosof, where Izzy is short for Isaac. I am nonbinary, and I use both they/them and she/her pronouns.
Check out my [introduction to my nonbinary gender](/2023/07/06/my-gender) for more info on my gender,
my [they/she Q&A](/2024/01/19/they-she) for more info on my pronouns,
or all of my [gender-related posts](gender).

In Fall 2024, I will be starting as a professor at Northwestern University,
in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences department.

I research stochastic queueing theory, with a focus on scheduling and resource allocation,
and optimal multiserver policies in particular.
If you are a first-year PhD student at Northwestern, a prospective student, or thinking of applying,
feel free to reach out to me, I am looking to recruit students.

I'm looking for students with a **strong mathematical background**, so please emphasize that element of your background if you reach out. A math background can be demonstrated via taking advanced math-heavy classes, class projects, or theoretical research. Backgrounds in math, statistics, theoretical computer science, or operations research are all conducive to my style of research.

I have received the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2023 Doctoral Dissertation Award**](https://sigmetrics.org/dissertationaward-2023.shtml),
the [**INFORMS 2022 George Nicholson Award**](publications/#the-gittins-policy-is-nearly-optimal-in-the-mgk-under-extremely-general-conditions),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award**](publications/#nudge-stochastically-improving-upon-fcfs),
the [**ACM SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#load-balancing-guardrails),
and the [**IFIP Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award**](publications/#srpt-for-multiserver-systems).
I was the [**2023 Tennenbaum Postdoctoral Fellow**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/research/isye-postdoctoral-fellowship-program) and a [**2023 Siebel Scholar**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005006/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2023).

Check out my [publications](publications), all of which you can download to read.

Check out my potential [project ideas](project-ideas),
which I'd be interested in advising a student to work on and/or interested in collaborating on.
