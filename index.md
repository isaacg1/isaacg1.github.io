![Isaac Grosof's portrait](/assets/portrait-small.jpg)

I'm Isaac Grosof, a third-year computer-science student at CMU.

I am advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).

I'm currently TAing [15-857](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Perfclass/class19fall.html).

My research interests include queueing theory, scheduling and performance modeling. I have a particular interest in multiserver scheduling and tail metrics in queueing.

In the past,
I have researched the complexity theory of abstract motion planning with [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/)
and information theoretic cryptography with [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/).
