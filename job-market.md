I am currently going on the job market, applying for faculty and postdoc positions
in computer science, operations research, and related departments.

### Application Materials

* [Research statement](/assets/research-statement.pdf)

### Selected papers

* [SRPT for Multiserver Systems](/assets/srpt.pdf) (Performance 2018)
  * Derives the first bounds on stochastic size-based multiserver scheduling,
  and proves the first optimality result in the stochastic multiserver setting:
  asymptotically optimal mean response time in the limit as arrival rate approaches capacity.

  * **Winner of the Performance 2018 Best Student Paper Award.**

  * Recommended first paper to read.

* [Load Balancing Guardrails: Keeping Your Heavy Traffic on the Road to Low Response Times](/assets/load-balancing.pdf) (SIGMETRICS 2019)
  * In the immediate-dispatch queueuing setting,
  we create a novel class of dispatching policies, *guardrails*.
  When a guardrails policy
  is combined with SRPT scheduling at the servers,
  the result is the first policy to achieve
  asymptotically optimal mean response time
  in the limit as arrival rate approaches capacity.

  * **Winner of the SIGMETRICS 2019 Best Student Paper Award.**

* [Nudge: Stochastically Improving upon FCFS](/assets/nudge.pdf) (SIGMETRICS 2021)
  * Creates *Nudge*, the first policy to achieve superior asymptotic tail latency to First-Come First-Served (FCFS), overturning the longstanding conjecture of FCFS's strong tail optimality. Moreover, we prove Nudge stochastically dominates FCFS throughout the latency distribution.

  * **Winner of the SIGMETRICS 2021 Best Paper Award.**

* [Optimal Scheduling in the Multiserver-job Model under Heavy Traffic](/assets/msj-srpt.pdf)
(Under submission)
  * In modern computing systems, jobs often require large and variable amounts of resources,
  modeled by the multiserver-job system.
  We create *ServerFilling-SRPT*,
  the first scheduling policy to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time
  in the limit as arrival rate approaches capacity.

### Recorded talks

Here is a longer (~45 minutes), live talk intended for a general audience:

Here is a shorter (~15 minutes), pre-recorded talk intended for a queueing-theory audience:
