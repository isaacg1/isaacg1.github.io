## Post 3: SRPT for Multiserver Systems

Time for my third paper: ["SRPT for Multiserver Systems"](/assets/srpt.pdf). This was the first paper I wrote during my PhD at CMU, submitted around the end of my first year. My coauthors were [Ziv Scully](https://ziv.codes/), then a fellow PhD student, now a postdoc at the Simons institute, soon to be a professor at Cornell, and [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/), my advisor (and Ziv's).
