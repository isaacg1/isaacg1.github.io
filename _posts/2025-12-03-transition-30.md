I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been thirty months since I started.

These were taken in Evanston, IL, and Skokie, IL.

![It was getting to be too much work to caption every photo, so I'm switching to just captioning the first one. Apologies. Me, a white emby with brown, wavy-curly hair, smiling up at the camera. There's green grass behinnd me, with small yellow and orange leaves mixed in. I'm wearing a thin purple jacket over a light-blue flower-print dress. I'm wearing metal green glasses.](/assets/album-12-03-25/pic01.jpg)
