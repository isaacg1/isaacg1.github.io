### Ritual for Morning Hormones

Ducks in a row, my dear spiro <br>
Make me graceful, fill with kindness <br>
Drink it down, into my guts.

(take pill)

Along for the ride, finasteride <br>
Move my hair to loving locks <br>
Drink it down, into my guts

(take pill)

Bubble bubble, my estradiol <br>
Make me smooth and let me feel <br>
Under my tongue, into my blood.

(take pills)

I know who I am <br>
I know what I want <br>
I cast my will <br>
Upon my mind <br>
Upon my body <br>
Upon the world

### Ritual for evening hormones

Ducks in a row, my dear spiro <br>
Make me graceful, fill with kindness <br>
Drink it down, into my guts.

(take pill)

Bubble bubble, my estradiol <br>
Make me smooth and let me feel <br>
Under my tongue, into my blood.

(take pill)

All my own, progesterone <br>
Swell my boobs, let me sleep <br>

(take pill)

I know who I am <br>
I know what I want <br>
I cast my will <br>
Upon my mind <br>
Upon my body <br>
Upon the world
