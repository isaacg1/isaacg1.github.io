If I could only talk <br>
In a way I could not bear to hear, <br>
Did I know how to talk at all?

Now I am learning to speak <br>
And learning to hear myself speak <br>
In a way I can take joy in.

I am crying to hear myself speak, <br>
The pain of a voice I fled from hearing, <br>
And the relief of knowing it might not be forever.

I only knew how to make sandpaper and rusty nails <br>
Come up out of my throat, <br>
And the best I could do was try not to hear them.

Now, I'm learning to make smooth, glossy, clean, new, <br>
musical, liquid, translucent, pure, alive, sounds. <br>
All from the same throat, the same me.

Learning to speak is hard, <br>
Because learning to speak means learning to hear, <br>
And I hurt to my core to hear my in-built voice.

But hard is not impossible, <br>
And pain is surmountable, <br>
And the future is bright and vibrant.

Now, I can speak. <br>
Speak, and hear myself. <br>
Hear, and feel joy.
