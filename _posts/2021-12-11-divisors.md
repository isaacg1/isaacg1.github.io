title: "Perfect Subsets of Divisor Multisets"
---

I encountered a clean mathematical problem in my research.
It seems simple, but turned out to be very finicky problem in my research.
I just solved it, with Katherine's invaluable help,
and I thought I'd post it here for others to see.

Let a *divisor multiset* S of size n
be a multiset of positive integers such that |S| = n,
and such that for all elements s in S, s divides n.

For instance, if n=6, then S=[1,1,1,2,2,3] is a divisor multiset.

Let a *perfect subset* S' of a divisor multiset S with |S|=n
be a subset of S such that the sum of the elements of S' is exactly n.

For instance, S=[1,1,1,2,2,3]
has three perfect subsets: [1,1,1,3], [1,1,2,2], [1,2,3].

The theorem we want to prove is that all divisor multisets have a perfect subset.

We weren't able to solve it in any sort of clean way,
but instead by accumulating a variety of techniques
for building perfect subsets,
and then doing an exhaustive case analysis on the factorization of n.

The glorious, five-page details are here: [Perfect Subsets](/assets/divisors.pdf).
