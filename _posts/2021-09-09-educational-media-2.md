Here I'm listing much of the media I've read/watched/listed to/etc., and learned something from. 

* Research popularization: [Book-Length Topology Re-proof](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-math-book-rescues-landmark-topology-proof-20210909/), by Kevin Harnett about a book by Ray, Behrens, Kalmar, Kim and Powell. In 1981 Michael Freedman proved a very important theorem in topology. But it was written so badly no one can follow it unless Freedman personally walks them through it. So five grad students rewrote the argument in full detail as a 500 page book.
