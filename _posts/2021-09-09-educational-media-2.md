Here I'm listing much of the media I've read/watched/listed to/etc., and learned something from. 

* Research popularization: [Book-Length Topology Re-proof](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-math-book-rescues-landmark-topology-proof-20210909/), by Kevin Harnett about a book by Ray, Behrens, Kalmar, Kim and Powell. In 1981 Michael Freedman proved a very important theorem in topology. But it was written so badly no one can follow it unless Freedman personally walks them through it. So five grad students rewrote the argument in full detail as a 500 page book.

* Research Talk: [Unique Games Conjecture] (https://youtu.be/-02d-oCd_xI), by Ryan O'Donnell at  the Institute for Advanced Study. One of the openest conjectures in computational complexity.

* Research Talk: [Implicit Regularization from Gradient Descent](https://youtu.be/aUYfjm6fpWs), by Wei Hi at the Simons Institute. Gradient Descent works well, even when "find an optimal solution" would fail. Why? Gradient Descent has implicit regularization: it select for something on top of low loss, which generalizes well.

* Research Talk: [Fine-grained worst-case to average-case reductions](https://youtu.be/bUAVYnlj3_k), by Andrea Lincoln at the Simons Institute. Andrea is a friend from undergrad. Some problems are exactly characterized within poly time, in the average case. Very exciting new work.

* Research talk: [Soft Astronomy](https://youtu.be/f50Va_SwWRM), by Alice Quillen, at the Institute for Advanced Study. Using soft-body models to model astronomical bodies, like asteroids being hit by impacts.

* History post: [Invention of the Computer](https://people.idsia.ch//~juergen/turing-oversold.html), by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber. The history of the hundreds of people who contributed to the development of the computer.
