Organizations I donate money to (and I think you should consider) 

* [Global Health and Development Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/global-development), via Effective Altruism Funds. Roughly $1200/year. Aims to improve health and economic outcomes for the most people for a given amount of money, often in the past countries in the world. Serves as a donation redistributor. Many organizations this fund sends money to are higher-risk, such as organizations that are just starting out.

* [Project Vesta](https://www.projectvesta.org/). Roughly $100/year. Working on an approach to reverse anthropogenic climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and oceans using enhanced rock weathering on beaches. Currently performing basic scientific research.

* [Gold Standard Marketplace](https://www.goldstandard.org/). Roughly $120/year. A platform where I purchase Carbon offsets by contributing to the creation of renewal energy plants in developing countries, e.g. India in my most recent contribution.
