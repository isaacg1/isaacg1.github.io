Let's calculate the value of a vote.
Specifically, a vote for US president.
I know I said we'd calculate the value of your vote,
but we're actually going to run the numbers
for my vote in 2020.
I'll make it clear where to adjust the calculation
to handle your vote.

First, what do I mean by value?
Who becomes president is important in many ways,
most very hard to quantify.
One way that is easier to quantify is control
over the actions of the executive branch,
by choosing cabinet members and setting policy.
How much is at stake in this decision?
Well, the discretionary budget of the US
is 1.4 trillion dollars per year,
so about **5.6 trillion dollars** over a four year
presidential term.

Next, how does the choice of president affect
how well this money is spent?
This step is a bit speculative,
but I'd estimate that the gap
between the societal benefit
of the two major presidential candidates
might be about **10%** of the money being spent.
One could argue that this number
is a bit high or low,
but I think it's about the right order of magnitude.
Of course, this assumes that I believe I'm voting for
the candidate who will bring more value to society
(Biden, in case you were wondering).
I do believe this, very strongly,
but feel free to adjust accordingly.
