If I'd hatched long, long ago, young enough to be a femme kid on the internet,
I'd've made a really fun, colorful, flashy page.
I'm hatched now, so it's time.

I was inspired by [maia arson crimew's site](https://maia.crimew.gay/)
-- it made such a cute site, I had to try it out myself.

<hr>

Wanna see a number get  <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>?

[Here's the rule](https://www.sligocki.com/2024/09/20/collatz-coincidence.html):

If you're just under a multiple of 3, you're out (and not <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>).
If you're a multiple of 3, or just over, you get to continue (and you're <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>~!).
To continue, divide out that 3, multiply by 5,
and you get 6 bonus if you were a multiple of 3, or 9 bonus if just over.

Let's get started! (◌̑∪◌̑)

First up, 0!

That maps to 6! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 66% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> so far -- in the top 66% of outcomes~!

6 maps to 16 (`3*2 → 5*2+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 44% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> now!

16 maps to 34 (`3*5+1 → 5*5+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 30% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> already!

34 maps to 64 (`3*11+1 → 5*11+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 20% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>! Dropping fast!

64 maps to 114 (`3*21+1 → 5*21+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 13% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>, and no signs of slowing down! 

114 maps to 196 (`3*38 → 5*38+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 8.8% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>! Notice how we always stay even,
because we add 6 with a modulus of 0 and 9 with a modulus of 1.
The parities match, so we stay even.
But that doesn't change how absurdly <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> we're getting!

196 maps to 334 (`3*65+1 → 5*65+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 5.8% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>,
and the mental arithmetic is just getting more and more fun~~!
See how far you can keep going~!

334 maps to 564 (`3*111+1 → 5*111+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 3.9% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> -- hey, that's statistically significant!

564 maps to 946 (`3*188 → 5*188+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 2.6% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>, and it's fun to multiply because we're really just dividing both ways, since 5 is so pretty to multiply!

946 maps to 1584 (`3*315+1 → 5*315+9`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 1.7% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>, how long can it keep it up?!?!

1584 maps to 2646 (`3*528 → 5*528+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 1.2% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>! I did mess up my mental math, oops~~

2646 maps to 4416 (`3*882 → 5*882+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 0.77% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>, and I'm back on track with my mental math!

4416 maps to 7366 (`3*1472 → 5*1472+6`)! <span class="rainbow">lucky!</span>

We're 0.51% <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>,
and we're just about ten times statistically significant, wow!

7366 maps to 12284 (`3*2455+1 → 5*2455+9`). Oh no! That's 2 mod 3!
<span style="color:firebrick">Not</span> <span class="rainbow">lucky</span> <span style="color:firebrick">☹☹☹.</span>

In the end, we're roughly 1 in 194 <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>,
or exactly 8192 in 1594323 <span class="rainbow">lucky</span>!
Yay!

Thanks for hanging out with some math with me!
