I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twenty-one months since I started, so here is the twenty-first batch of photos.
These were taken in Evanston, IL.
It was really cold, but I liked taking them.

![Me, a white enby with brown curly hair and large circular classes. I'm smiling and looking into the camera and wearing a black-rainbow hat with pronoun pins on it and a black shiny coat. I'm standing on a sports field with some snow on the ground in the background.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic01.jpg)
![Same except picture taken from above, with me looking up into the camera.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic02.jpg)
![Same except sunnier, with the sun on the right side of my face and body.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic03.jpg)
![I'm smiling broadly with my mouth open, with some pine needles in the foreground.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic04.jpg)
![Me in front of a colorful array of graffiti.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic05.jpg)
![Me in front of a frozen river.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic06.jpg)
![Same except with my hat off, hair in all directions.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic07.jpg)
![Hat on again, emphasizing the blue-green color of the frozen river.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic08.jpg)
![With the sky and a hillside behind me.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic09.jpg)
![With a bridge and brown vegetation behind me.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic10.jpg)
![I'm standing on the side support of the bridge, with the side of the bridge on the right, my head almost touching to upper side of the bridge support, and a wide landscape behind me, emphasizing the blue curve of the river with the sun glinting off it.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic11.jpg)
![Closer into my face, which is reddened from the cold and smiling widely.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic12.jpg)
![I've opened my jacket to show my dress, blue with big vibrant red and white flowers. The sun is direcly behind my head, glinting through my hair.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic13.jpg)
![Back down to the river, with a line of sun behind me on the blue-ice river.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic14.jpg)
![Same except taken from above, over the green-white ice.](/assets/album-01-19-25/pic15.jpg)

As a bonus, here's a lovely sketch of me that a friend recently drew:
