I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twenty months since I started, so here is the twentieth batch of photos.
These were taken in Evanston, IL.

![Me, a white enby with brown, curly, shoulder length hair, smiling. I'm wearing a black tanktop with a blue-purple cat on it, a black pufy coat down around my elbows, and a bright yellow skirt. I'm standing in a field in front of a bare-branched tree with a flat grey sky.](/assets/album-12-18-24/pic01.jpg)
