I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twenty-two months since I started, so here is the twenty-second batch of photos.
These were taken in Evanston, IL.
It was really cold, but I had a photographer, which was very nice.

![Me, a white enby with brown curly hair and large circular classes. I'm wearing a black coat, a bright yellow skirt and a white top with small flowers on it. I have one red glove and one black gove on, and I'm wearing black boots with rainbow laces. I'm standing in front of a graffitied bridge support, with white snow over the rocky ground.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic01.jpg)
![Same location, I'm tilting my head to the left and leaning to the right, with a big smile on my face.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic02.jpg)
![Another happy learning smile, more of a downward photograph angle.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic03.jpg)
![I'm standing in front of a snowed-over river, with my coat down around my elbows, with the opposite bank behind my head.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic04.jpg)
![Same except I'm leaning back and facing left.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic05.jpg)
![Same except I'm laughing so much my eyes are closed and my jacket is back on my shoulders.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic06.jpg)
![A more zoomed out photo, from up a hill, with the vast white river behind me. My arms are spread wide and my mouth is open wide in joy.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic07.jpg)
![Same except my head is tilted back to the sky and I'm facing left.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic08.jpg)
![Same except facing right.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic09.jpg)
![Same except facing right at the camera, a bit of my stomach showing.](/assets/album-02-22-25/pic10.jpg)
