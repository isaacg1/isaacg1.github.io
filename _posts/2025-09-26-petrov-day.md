September 26th is a holiday.
Full of significance, lessons, richness.
September 26th is Stanislav Petrov Day.

On [September 26th, 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident), a nuclear war almost began.

In 1982, in the context of severe Cold War tensions,
the Soviet Union brought online an early warning satellite, Oko.
Oko was designed to detect American nuclear missile launches.
On September 26th, 1983, it sounded the alarm.
A nuclear missile was on its way.
Maximum certainty, all automatic verification checks passed.

[Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov)
was the officer on duty.
His responsibility was to determine whether a missile was detected,
and report it to his superiors,
who would determine if missiles on the way warranted a launch by the Soviet Union,
or if they should wait for the missiles to explode.
His superiors would be woken in the middle of the night,
told that an American nuclear missile was on the way,
and given ten minutes to decide what to do.

Petrov didn't entirely trust the satellite's warning.
He had misgivings.
He waited for more information -- to see if the ground radar would pick up anything.

Instead, the Oko system sounded more alarms.
Four more missiles were on the way.
Maximum certainty, all automatic verifications passed.

Still, something felt off to Petrov.
Only five missiles for a first strike -- it didn't feel plausible.
So Petrov didn't sign off on the detection,
didn't report it up the chain.
He wasn't certain he was right -- he feared he'd done the wrong thing.

And a nuclear World War III didn't start that day.

For a more thorough, but still quite approachable video on this day, I recommend Jon Bois's [recently resurrected video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU8MCtPoKnM) on Petrov and on September 26th, 1983.

September 26th, 2025, will be the 42nd Stanislav Petrov Day.

It is a day of remembrance.
Not for those who died that day,
but for those who could have.
And those who might never have existed.

If that day went differently.
If the false alarm was reported up the chain.
If an immediate retaliatory strike was ordered,
If nuclear war resulted in nuclear winter,
mass deaths and mass starvation.
If.

And yet, we are alive.

<div style="height:1em; margin-left:12.5%; margin-right:12.5%"><hr /></div>

We live in a world of vast hierarchies.
Dozens and hundreds and thousands and millions of people,
compressed to work towards goals they do not choose,
do not see,
do not approve of,
do not consent to.

It takes millions of people to invent nuclear bombs
and separate the fissile material
and stockpile them
and build an early warning satellite network
and launch it
and pay the taxes the fund the entire apparatus.

It takes millions of people to fund
[intentionally provocative military exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83#Psychological_operations),
designed to heighten tensions and test vulnerabilities.

And it takes very few people to launch a retaliatory strike.
These hierarchies concentrate choices into the hands of those very few people.
The people who sit atop the hierarchies we live within
are not especially well-suited to the responsibility they hold.

It takes very few people to create a policy of [launch on warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_on_warning),
combined with a deeply flawed warning system.

They didn't get to the top by demonstrating
care for the interests of the people they affect,
responsibility and foresight and caution with the power they lead,
or faithfulness to the people whose labor builds their power.

They got to the top through skill in navigating these hierarchies,
coalition forming and knowing who to be loyal to and who to stab in the back,
deals and stratagems and secrets.

And these hierarchies place our lives in their hands.
That's our role. We are but cogs in the machine,
our designated roles leaving us no flexibility but to pass the choices up the chain.
That's not just the US. That's not just the Soviet Union.
It is the nature of our lives today around the world, the nature of our roles.

But our designated roles aren't all of us.
We exist, outside those roles.

We don't have to follow orders.
At the end of the day, orders are just words and threats.
We do have choices.

Stanislav Petrov Day is a day for remembering that we have the choice to not follow orders.

<div style="height:1em; margin-left:12.5%; margin-right:12.5%"><hr /></div>

We live in vast hierarchies, still. And those hierarchies channel power
to those tiny few on top, still.
And those few on top corrupt anything and everything they can get their hands on.

I'm talking about the American federal government system.
I'm talking about President Donald Trump.
His hands wield the power that us millions create.
Of taxes, of loyalties, of implicit and explicit powers.
Of labor control and funding control and legal control and illegal control.

We have our orders, past and present.
We will be told who to cast out into the cold.
We will be cast out into the cold ourselves.
Just following orders.
Just fulfilling our designated roles.

Words and threats and choices.

<div style="height:1em; margin-left:12.5%; margin-right:12.5%"><hr /></div>

If your neighbor is playing loud music late at night
and you call the cops and they get a ticket,
they might get detained.
They might get imprisoned.
They might get deported.

You didn't know.
You don't know who lives next door.
You were just fulfilling your designated role.

If someone's flailing and screaming in anger and suffering
and you cut them out of your community,
they might turn inward.
They might fall apart.
They might end.

You didn't know.
You don't know what's making them lash out like that.
You were just fulfilling your designated role.

If the rules at your school say that you have to
███
your
█████
student to their
██████,
and you divulge their secret,
they might get ███████.
They might get █████████.
They might ███.

You didn't know.
You don't know what their ███████ are like.
You were just fulfilling your designated role.

Words and threats and choices.

<div style="height:1em; margin-left:12.5%; margin-right:12.5%"><hr /></div>

The end isn't nigh.

For the same reason it wasn't 42 years ago.

Because we aren't mindless cogs.

Because the hierarchies aren't rigid.

Because those few on top don't have all the power.

Because we do have choices.

Happy Stanislav Petrov Day.
