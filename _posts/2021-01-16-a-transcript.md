title: "Transcribing Michael Lindell (MyPillow CEO)'s notes for a meeting at the White House"
---

Michael Lindell is the CEO of MyPillow and is a close ally of President Trump, serving as the President's 2020 campaign chair for the state of Minnesota.
Today, Lindell went to the White House for a brief meeting with the President and others.
Before going in, Lindell showed [his notes](https://twitter.com/jabinbotsford/status/1350186100564905985/photo/1) to a photographer.
I have transcribe them here. Transcriptions in [brackets] are speculative, while outside of brackets I'm fairly certain.
Note that the visible  section consists of the second half of each line.
