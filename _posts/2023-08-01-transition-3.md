I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
I just started taking Spironolactone, an anti-androgen,
so I might start to see an increase in effects.
It's been three months since I started, so here is the third batch of photos.
These were taken at Phipps conservatory by a wonderful friend.
This is my last month of photos from Pittsbugh
-- I've now defended my thesis, received my PhD, and moved to Atlanta to start my postdoc.
