title: 'Paper 4: Load Balancing Guardrails'
---
Time for my fourth paper: [Load balancinng guardrails](/assets/guardrails.pdf). This was the second paper I wrote during my PhD at CMU, and it builds upon my first paper on [SRPT-k](/assets/srpt.pdf). My coauthors once again were [Ziv Scully](https://ziv.codes/), then a fellow PhD student, now a postdoc at the Simons institute, soon to be a professor at Cornell, and [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/), my advisor (and Zivâ€™s).
