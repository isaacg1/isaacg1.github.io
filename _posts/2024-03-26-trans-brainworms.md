An extremely common trans experience, especially before we know we're trans,
is finding reasons why we can't be trans.
These reasons are borne of our fears, our self-doubts,
our internalized transphobia, and many other negative thoughts we have towards ourselves.

I call these self-repressing reasons *brainworms*.
It's a somewhat common term in trans circles, but definitely not universal.

A major part of hatching (i.e. coming to understand that we are trans)
is moving through these narratives thrashing around in our minds,
to find who we truly are.

It's not easy, and you're not alone.
If you're going through these thoughts, feel free to email me.

In this post I'm gong to explore some common brainworms,
both ones that I've told myself,
and one's I've seen in other people.
I'll explore why we tell ourselves them,
and why they're not true.
I'll mark ones that I've had in my head with a ✨.

And maybe you're telling yourself these same reasons.
That's Ok.
Your true self is in there.
Maybe you'll work through these feelings,
introspect on them or confront them or dissect them.
Or maybe over time they'll just stop feeling so important.
Or maybe you'll take your own path.

Before I jump in, a few disclaimers:

* Not everyone who has these thoughts is trans, though many are.
I don't know whether you're trans, and this post won't immediately tell you.
But working your way through these brainworms, if they're in your head,
will make it easier to see yourself,
for who you really are.

* Any given person probably won't have every brainworm,
and I'm sure there are one's I've never heard of.

* Take it slow. It took me years, maybe even a decade to get to where I am now,
resolved enough to make a post like this.
If the emotions are heavy, rest, go at your own pace.
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

* Brainworms don't just vanish when we hatch (realize we're trans).
They arise again at many times,
including around coming out (telling others we're trans),
medical stuff, and whenever we're feeling bad.
This post focuses on pre-hatching brainworms, however.

* I am transfemme, and that colors my topics and my commentary,
but similar brainworms exist for transmasc people, transneutral people,
and other kinds of trans people.

## Common Brainworms

### ✨ "It's just a sex/fetish/kink thing, right?"

This is probably the most common trans brainworm,
I know so many trans people who thought this before they hatched.

There are a lot of reasons why this brainworm lodges in people's minds.
Some of it relates to historical and medical transphobia.
Some of it is societal.
Doc Impossible at
[Stained Glass Woman](https://stainedglasswoman.substack.com/p/beneath-the-surface)
has a nice essay on this brainworm in particular.

For me, I think the reason that this narrative lodged in my mind
is because in a sexuality context,
I find it very distressing
when I notice or am reminded of masculine characteristics.
I have gender dysphoria from experiencing masculinity and sexuality at the same time.

So naturally, I gravitate towards sexual concepts and ways of experiencing sexuality
that are free from that.
And I experience gender affirmation
from experiencing femininity and sexuality at the same time.
So I gravitate towards that, as well.

And I have leaned decisively in this direction since long before I hatched.
It wasn't the earliest sign, in retrospect,
but it was one of the more noticeable early signs.

So in those early days, when I had very little self-understanding,
I wasn't yet thinking of myself as
"someone who leans towards femininity and away from masculinity".
I was thinking of myself as
"someone who, *in a sexual context*, leans towards femininity and away from masculinity".
And so I didn't start exploring or questioning my gender for many, many years.
Because I siloed off my sexuality from the rest of me.

In retrospect, it's blindingly obvious what was going on.
I am transfemme and have always been,
and my sexuality is transfemme and has always been.
There's no "just" about it, and there never has been.

### ✨ Exploring gender is gross and disgusting and shameful

This is the brainworm that tells us
"I can't try on that dress,
and if I do I certainly can't let anyone see me like that,
I'd be disgusting."
As with many brainworms, this partially derives from society,
and is partially internal.
Society definitely pushes a message that gender nonconformity is gross,
and there certainly are people who explicitly or implicitly
believe that.

But there's more than that.
For many of us, exploring gender can be a minefield.
Clothes that could be gender-affirming,
if they fit poorly or not at all,
can feel worse than not even trying.
An incongruous gender expression,
like lipstick with facial hair,
can feel worse than not trying.
And if this happens a couple of times,
and if these narratives are already circulating,
then the full-blown brainworm can arise.

This is not true.
Gender exploration is, in fact, wonderful and beautiful,
regardless of how much practice you have.
Regardless of whether it's being done in a nonconforming way
or looking for a core gender true or for any reason.
The nail polish does look good on you.
That crop top is cute.
I love the new voice you're trying out.
I don't care where your skills are,
I'm glad you're trying something new.

### Trans people always knew

Another common brainworm tells us that
"I can't be trans because real trans people always knew that they were trans,
and I'm just now considering it."

In the past, society was a lot more trans-exclusionary and transphobic than it is now.
As a result, everyone who wasn't overwhelmingly certain that they were trans
was shoved into the closet or into the shell.
So trans people, to be visible, often had to leave no room for uncertainty or vulnerability.

It's becoming more common for trans people to be open about their uncertainty,
and about the long path towards hatching (like me! Hi!),
but the narrative has been around long enough to be a brainworm.

Of course, it's false.
Hatching is always complicated,
and when it happens doesn't say anything about how real a trans person is.
You don't have to be perfect to be trans.
You can be messy and complicated -- basically everyone is.

### ✨ I'm just a boring cis straight person, nothing interesting going on here

There was an LGBTQ+ club in my high school.
Did I go to it? No, and I never seriously considered going.
Because I didn't think of myself as LGBTQ+.
I thought of myself as ordinary, nothing noteworthy going on.

There was an LGBTQ+ club in my undergrad.
Did I go to it? No, even though I was actively exploring my gender by that point.
Because I didn't think of myself as LGBTQ+.
I didn't connect the thoughts "I'm exploring my gender"
with "There are other people with similar experiences".

I didn't have "queer" as part of my identity.
I didn't think of finding community as a possibility.

But community is a place for people to explore, not just for people who have already hatched.
I finally joined an LGBTQ+ club in graduate school.
I finally explored with other people.
I finally incorporated "exploring" into my sense of self.
