Inspired by this [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/Y30VF3cSIYQ), I decided to try to solve problem six of the 1988 International Mathematics Olympiad. I did not solve it from scratch, however. I've seen the solution before, but long enough ago that I've forgotten the details. This shouldnt be too hard, but still fun.
