The fair gambler's ruin problem is as follows: Suppose a gambler is repeatedly betting a dollar on the flip of a coin. The gambler starts with one dollar, and stops if they ever drop to zero dollars. How likely is it that the gambler is still going after n flips?

We'll try and answer this in two ways: With a rough, heuristic argument, and exactly.

Note the game is "fair" in the sense that the expected amount of money that the gambler has is always 1, however many flips have occurred. Nonetheless, the gambler eventually stops with probability 1. This is a null-recurrent Markov chain.

## Heuristic

Let's approach this from the other side: after how many flips does the probability that the gambler is still flipping drop to p? Think of p as a small probability like 1%.

Since the game is fair, conditioning on the game not being over, the gambler has 1/p dollars on average. The evolution of the gambler's money resembles Brownian motion. K steps of Brownian motion have a variance of `k^.5`. Thus, for the Brownian motion to have reached 1/p with probability p took about 1/p^2 flips.

Thus, the chance that the gambler is still going after n steps is about `1/n^.5`.

## Exact
