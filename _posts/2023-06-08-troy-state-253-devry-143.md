title: "Troy State 253, DeVry 143"

On
[January 12th, 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men%27s_basketball_game),
Troy State University and DeVry University of Atlanta
played the highest scoring basketball game in NCAA basketball history.
This much is agreed on.

However, the final score of the game is much less clear.
The scoreboard couldn't handle scores of 200 or higher,
as a score that high had never been reached before.
Once Troy State's score reached 200,
confusion began, and the score got muddled.

The official final score was
[258-141](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men%27s_basketball_game),
which matches the score on the scoreboard at the end of the game.
However, when Jon Bois, a YouTube sports video maker at SB Nation,
went through a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWEMDwJPNU4)
of the game basket-by-basket,
he got a result of [253-141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4afzQyGo5Q).
I strongly recommend watching the video,
which is a part of Jon's "Pretty Good" series.
It's very well made and gives an excellent background to the game.
However, I disagree with its final score.
Unfortunately, as the raw basket-by-basket data was not posted,
I can't double-check the video's work.

When I went through the same recording back in 2020,
I got a final result of 253-143, which I documented in this
[second-by-second spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RLiTzxCxAkDKjmJDEcUjhoavWwCJ88gnJUOz1G7F_PY/edit?usp=sharing).

Since no one's ever gotten the same result twice, I don't trust any of these results.
I've done a fresh, second-by-second count-through of the game for this blog post,
working exclusively off the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWEMDwJPNU4)
posted by "kip SMITHERS".
I've written up, in the final section of this post, an exhaustive account of the game:
Every basket made, every shot taken, every time the announcers said the score,
every time the scoreboard was visible.
Based on that analysis, I've given the definitive final score in the summary section below.

It's entirely possible that I've made mistakes too.
Please get in touch if you think I have.
## Summary

By my count, the correct final score of this game is **253-143**.

I believe that the person operating the scoreboard,
as reflected in the announcers' callouts,
made the following mistakes:

* At 56:03 in the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWEMDwJPNU4),
while the scorer was adjusting the scoreboard,
DeVry scored a 3-point basket to bring the score to 203-114.
This basket was incorrectly recorded for Troy State,
so the scoreboard said 206-111.

* In the interval 1:00:19-1:01:12,
Troy State scored a 2-point and a 3-point basket,
but was recorded as gaining 7 points,
from 225 to 232 points.

* At 1:01:31, Troy State scored a 3-point basket,
but was recorded as gaining 4 points,
from 232 to 236 points.

* At 1:05:00, Troy State scored a 3-point basket,
but was recorded as gaining 4 points,
from 249 to 253 points.

* In the interval 1:05:04-1:06:36,
Troy State scored a pair of 2-point baskets,
but was recorded as gaining 2 points,
from 253 to 255 points.
It is unclear whether a basket was not recorded,
or whether a prior mistake was corrected.

* At 1:07:24, as time expired, DeVry scored a 3-point basket,
but was recorded as gaining 4 points, from 137 to 141 points.

The cumulative effect of these errors
was to record 5 more points for Troy State than was correct,
and 2 fewer points for DeVry,
resulting in a recorded score of 258-141,
as compared to the correct score of 253-143.

I believe that Jon's mistake was:

* The first point where Jon's video specifies a score that he believes is correct
is the score 200-105, matching the announcement at 55:29 in the game recording,
and at 23:37 in [Jon's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4afzQyGo5Q).
However, this score is not correct. 
The actual score at this point in the game is 200-107.
Earlier in the recording, at 54:18,
before any scoreboard problems began,
the announcer had already specified that DeVry had reached 107 points.
This previous score was consistent with the game and the announcements up to that point.
The 105 announcement that Jon relies on is an error.

In the [written document](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/3/16/14935888/devry-vs-troy-1992-basketball-score-wrong-ncaa-record) that accompanies the video,
Jon specifies that up to the score announcement of 200-105, "I scored the entire game, but up until this point, there were no discrepancies between my score and that of the gameâ€™s scorer or announcers."
This is impossible, given that the score DeVry 107 had already been announced.
The error must have occurred previously.

As a result of this error,
the final score announced in the Jon's video was 253-141,
compared to the correct score of 253-143.

## Second-by-second breakdown

I will document:
* Every time a basket is scored, and how many points I think it is worth.
* Every time a shot was missed (or blocked).
* Every time a foul is called.
* Every time the announcers announce a score.
* Every time the scoreboard is visible.
* Any commentary on where a mistake may have occurred.
* Every time the video drops a segment,
and what I think happened during the segment.

For each documented event, I will give the timestamp in the
[kip SMITHERS recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWEMDwJPNU4),
to the second, when the event occurs.

I will keep track of the discrepancy between the score that I believe is correct,
and the scoreboard/announcers' score.
I will **bold** any event in which that discrepancy changes,
as those changes are indicative of mistakes being made.
Note that some mistakes are committed by the announcers,
and are temporary,
while others are presumably committed by the scorer, and stay on the scoreboard.
Note that the scoreboard is typically out of frame,
so we typically only have the announcers to go by.
I will also note where I believe that Jon's video made its mistake in bold.

Feel free to skim and only read the bold points, or to read every detail.
Things start to get interesting around timestamp 54:30,
when Troy State's score nears 200.

### The game
Each event starts with a timestamp.
In each event, I write the score in the order (Troy State)-(DeVry).
If I write a score, it refers to my tracking of the score,
unless noted otherwise.
Each timestamp of a shot marks the time when the ball left the players hand,
and the corresponding score refers to the score after the shot in question.

* 53:24: Timeout called.

* 54:18: Announcer: DeVry 107. Note that this contradicts the announcement at 55:29,
where the announcer says that DeVry has 105 points.
I believe this announcement to be the correct one,
because it lines up with my ongoing count,
and it also lines up the announcement at 53:13 of 105 for DeVry,
after which there has been one successful basket for DeVry,
which was acknowledged by the announcers.

* 54:34: 193-107. Missed 3-point shot by Troy State.

* 54:43: 193-107. Missed 2-point shot by DeVry.

* 54:43: Announcer: "Something happened to the scoreboard".
**This is where confusion begins.**

* 54:46: Announcer: "What happened to Troy State's score? Disappeared.".

* 54:48: Announcer: "I don't know, the score --"

* 54:50: 195-107. 2-point basket by Troy State.

* 54:54: Announcer (background):
"Ladies and gentlemen, so many points have been scored it's rolled the scoreboard,
Trojan's points will be kept where the fouls are recorded."

* 55:00: 195-107. Missed 2-point shot by DeVry.

* 55:06: 197-107. 2-point basket by Troy State.
Occurs out of frame, but is clearly a 2-point basket.

* 55:11: Announcer: "What's that -- What's that give us now, one -- We're very close to 200."

* 55:14: 197-107. Missed 2-point shot by DeVry.

* 55:21: 200-107. 3-point basket by Troy State.

* 55:23: Announcer: "That's 200 points. 200 points exactly."

* 55:29: Announcer: 200-105. **Discrepancy**: This is 2 fewer points for DeVry than I have.
It is also fewer points for DeVry than DeVry had back at 54:18.
I think this was a mistake. See 54:18 for further reasoning.
I think the mistake was corrected before 55:47,
as one basket is made by DeVry between now and then,
when DeVry is announced to have 109 points.

  * I think that Jon's mistake was that he
**started counting from here, during a temporary mistake,**
or else made a mistake previously that made him incorrectly think
that this score was accurate.
In Jon's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4afzQyGo5Q), at 23:37,
he makes a chart of "every score once Troy State reached 200 points".
It starts at this moment, with a claimed score of 200-105.
He refers to this as "The last moment at which I agree with the scorer."
The 2 fewer points for DeVry in this announcement
match the 2 fewer points for DeVry in Jon's final score (141)
as compared to my final score (143).
Note that our scores for Troy State match (both 253).
Other than this disagreement, my scorekeeping and the video's scorekeeping match.
I believe that this video's only major mistake was to use
this incorrect score as its starting point, or as a confirmation point.

* 55:30: 200-109. 2-point basket by DeVry.

* 55:37: 200-109. Missed 3-point shot by Troy State.

* 55:37: Announcer: "And it's the combination of the player's number and fouls, so it's a multicolored 200."

* 55:42: 203-109. 3-point basket by Troy State.

* 55:45: Announcer: 203-109. **No discrepancy**, indicating that 55:29 was a temporary mistake. Announcer: "And this is some creative scorekeeping here".

* 55:54: 203-111. 2-point basket by DeVry.

* 55:57: Announcer: DeVry 111. No discrepancy.

* 56:00: Announcer: "Now you don't think one of their people sabotaged the scoreboard?
Now wait a second, they got the -- Now they're getting it cranked up. -- There it is."
This indicates that something was temporarily wrong with the scoreboard. Maybe it was turned off and on again?

* 56:03: 203-114. 3-point basket by DeVry.

* 56:12: 206-114. 3-point basket by Troy State.

* 56:15: Announcer: 209-111. **Discrepancy**:
This is 3 more points for Troy State than I have, and 3 fewer points for DeVry,
which I will write as (+3, -3)
My guess for what happened is that during the scoreboard problem that the announcer mentions at 56:00, DeVry scored a 3-point basket, and the scorer accidentally attributed that basket to Troy State as they were getting the scoreboard back up again.

* 56:21-56:38: 206-116. 2-point basket by DeVry. Video cuts out for this interval, just a couple frames survive. During this time, Devry definitely shoots a 2-point shot,
and then we see Troy State inbound the ball, so DeVry must have just scored a basket.

* 56:38: 206-116. Horn blows for unclear reason, possibly in error,
as the ball is inbounded.
Resulting play doesn't count.

* 57:07: Scoreboard: 209-113. Discrepancy unchanged: (+3, -3).
Scoreboard is in the process of switching from player-fouls to
a new representation: Troy State's score records the excess over 200,
while DeVry's score is recorded normally.

* 57:21: Announcer: 209-113. Discrepancy unchanged: (+3, -3).

* 57:42: 206-116. DeVry does something out of frame, probably misses a shot.
There's no indication of a basket from any of the announcers.

* 57:49: 206-116. Missed 3-point shot by Troy State.

* 57:54: 206-116. Foul called on Troy State. No foul shots.

Relative to my accounting, the announcers have added 2 more points to Troy's score.
Relative to 1:00:19, Troy State has apparently added 7 points on 2 shots.
This must be wrong. I think that a phantom 2 points were added to Troy State's score
between 1:00:19 and here.

Exactly one 3-point basket has been made since the last announcement,
and yet Troy has gone up by 4 points.
This must be wrong.
Perhaps a 3-point gain was manually entered and one too many points was added?
