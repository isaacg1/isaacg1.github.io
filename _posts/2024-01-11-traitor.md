title: 'Trump, the Traitor'
---

Former President Donald Trump is a traitor.
He betrayed America by attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election and hang on to power.
No person who believes in the ideals of America should support this traitor.

Trump is in the same category as the other traitors of American history,
like Benedict Arnold, who betrayed America during the war of independence,
like confederates such as Jefferson Davis, who attacked America in their attempt to secede and maintain slavery,
and like Fritz Duquesne, who ran a massive spy ring in the United States during World War II
to steal military secrets for the Nazis.

Trump should be held in the same disgust and revulsion as these traitors.

## The betrayal

Trump's betrayal of America is documented in the report of the
[January 6th Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack),
and the indictment documents of the prosecutions of Trump for his attempt to subvert the election,
both in [Federal court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case))
and in [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_election_racketeering_prosecution).

You should [read the federal indictment of Trump](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/08/trump-indictment.pdf)
if you have not already,
which lays out the details of Trump's betrayal.
I will summarize the key elements of Trump's betrayal here.

Starting immediately after election day on November 3rd, 2020,
Trump conducted a pressure campaign to attempt to sway a wide swath of government officials
to corruptly declare him president, in contravention of the will of the American voters
and the laws of America.
Trump conducted these pressure campaigns against government officials
in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
He convened fraudulent, traitorous slates of electors in those five state as well as in Nevada and New Mexico.
Moreover, he attempted to pressure federal government officials, including the Vice President and the members of the Houses of Congress,
to subvert the country and the election and keep him in power.
Among the many tools of this pressure campaign was the insurrection against the capital on January 6th, 2021,
which Trump and his criminal subordinates used
to continue to pressure federal officials into handing the presidency to him.

Trump's betrayal of America should live in infamy, and I will lay out the details here.

### Betrayal in Arizona

On November 22nd, 2020, Trump and his criminal subordinate Rudy Giuliani called the Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives,
a Republican named Rusty Bowers,
to pressure him to use the Arizona legislature to throw out the legitimate election results
and corruptly declare that Trump had won the election.
As part of this attempt to suborn the Arizona Speaker,
Trump and Giuliani falsely claimed that many non-citizens and non-residents had voted in Arizona,
and that many fraudulent votes were cast in the names of dead people.
Trump and Giuliani knew their claims were false,
as they presented no evidence of fraud, and knew they had no evidence of fraud.
The attempt was solely an attempt to hang on to power,
cloaked in a paper-thin veil of claims of election fraud.
The Arizona Speaker rejected Trump's demands that the Speaker betray his state and the nation
and corruptly hand the election to Trump.

On December 1st, 2020, Giuliani met with the Arizona Speaker in person,
to continue the pressure campaign.
When the Arizona Speaker asked for evidence of
the outcome-determinative election fraud that he and Trump had been claiming,
Giuliani acknowledged to the Speaker that he had no evidence of this fraud.

On December 4th, the Arizona Speaker issued a public statement in reference to this pressure campaign,
stating in part:

> I and my fellow legislators swore an oath to support the U.S. Constitution
> and the constitution and laws of the state of Arizona.
> It would violate that oath, the basic principles of republican government,
> and the rule of law if we attempted to nullify the people's vote
> based on unsupported theories of fraud.
> Under the laws that we wrote and voted upon,
> Arizona voters choose who wins, and our system requires that their choice be respected.

It was this oath, these laws, and these basic principles that Trump betrayed,
and that he attempted to convince the Arizona Speaker to betray.

On January 4th, 2021, John Eastman, another criminal subordinate of Trump's,
pressured the Arizona Speaker to use the state legislature to decertify the state's
legitimate presidential electors, who had voted three weeks previously in now-President Biden's favor.
Eastman did not dispute the fact that there was no evidence of substantial fraud in Arizona,
but implored the Arizona Speaker to decertify the results anyways.
The Arizona Speaker again refused, stating that he would stick to the oath he had made to uphold the US Constitution.

In 2022, the Arizona Speaker was defeated in a primary election to remain in the Arizona state legislature,
losing against a Trump-endorsed opponent as a direct result of refusing to join Trump's traitorous plot.
The threat to support a primary candidate in running against the Speaker
if he did not join Trump's scheme
was an implicit part of Trump's pressure campaign,
and was carried out even after the pressure campaign failed.
