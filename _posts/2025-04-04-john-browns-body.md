This is my rendition of "John Brown's Body", the American Civil War marching song.
This version is based off of Pete Seeger's 1959 recording.

## Lyrics

John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave, <br>
John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave, <br>
John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave, <br>
But his soul goes marching on. <br>

Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
But his soul goes marching on. <br>

The stars above in heaven are a-looking kindly down, <br>
The stars above in heaven are a-looking kindly down, <br>
The stars above in heaven are a-looking kindly down, <br>
On the grave of old John Brown. <br>

Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
But his soul goes marching on. <br>

He captured Harper's ferry with his nineteen men so true, <br>
He frightened old Virginia till she trembled through and through, <br>
They hanged him for a traitor, they themselves the traitor crew. <br>
His soul goes marching on. <br>

Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
His soul goes marching on. <br>

Well, he's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord, <br>
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord, <br>
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord, <br>
But his soul goes marching on. <br>

Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
His soul goes marching on. <br>

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord, <br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath is stored. <br>
He loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword, <br>
His truth is marching on. <br>

Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah, <br>
His soul goes marching on.
