## Educational media list, 08/15  to 08/31

Here I'm listing much of the media I've read/watched/listed to/etc., and learned something from. This list will cover the next half month. Generally, if I list something here I'm recommending it. If not, I'll try to mention it.

I'm not going to give a big explanation of each item, because that'll probably get in the way of me posting. Generally, I'm just going for media type, creator, title, possibly venue, possibly a brief description.

* Review Video: [Debunking Pentagon UFO Videos](https://youtu.be/jHDlfIaBEqw) by Corridor Crew. VFX artists review videos of Unidentified Arial Phenomena, conclude that they are camera artifacts/birds/etc.

* Experiment Video: [Gauge Blocks under Vacuum](https://youtu.be/Z5XOk1oMFh0) by Applied Science. Gauge Blocks are highly polished metal blocks that stick together when they are pressed against each other.

* Law Podcast: [Pearls are in the Eye of the Beholder](https://www.nationalsecuritylawpodcast.com/), by Bobby Chesney and Steve Vladek, law professors at UT Austin. Usual round-up of topics, at a really high level, very enjoyable.
