I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twenty-three months since I started, so here is the twenty-third batch of photos.
These were taken in Evanston, IL and at the Chicago Botanical Garden.

![Me, a white enby with curly brown hair. I'm wearing a red-puple jacket and I have pink hearts drawn on my cheeks. I'm standing in front of a couple of pine trees.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic01.jpg)
![I've unzipped the jacket, showing a dress with a black top and a sunflower-pattern lower part.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic02.jpg)
![Back to my face. My hair has very voluminous curls.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic03.jpg)
![There's pine needles in front of my face, and I'm wearing an "I voted" sticker.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic04.jpg)
![I've spread my arms and am now visible from head to toe.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic05.jpg)
![The camera is tilted and I'm leaning the opposite direction, so I'm vertical in the photo by the trees and horizon are leaning.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic06.jpg)
![Same angle, and I'm now facing up and to the right.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic07.jpg)
![Close up on just my face and my very wide smile, with the blue sky and puffy clouds behind me.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic08.jpg)
![I'm in front of a lake, it's very sunny, my smooth arm is emphasized.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic09.jpg)
![I have my hand on my hip and the photo is from above, with a hint of the sunflowers on my dress.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic10.jpg)
![I'm half tilted towards the viewer and there's blurry pine needles in the foreground.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic11.jpg)
![Just my face, taken from below. My curls are blowing across my face and the sun is visible through my hair on the right.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic12.jpg)
![I'm in front of a lake with green water vegetation growing in it. My cheeks are very rosy. The sparkle of the sun on the water is visible to the left.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic13.jpg)
![I'm smelling a little pink flower in profile, and grinning hugely.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic14.jpg)
![In front of the lake with green vegetation again, with a puffy black jacket now.](/assets/album-03-27-25/pic15.jpg)
