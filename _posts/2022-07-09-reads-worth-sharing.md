## Reads Worth Sharing

Articles that I read, that I liked and you might like too (videos, etc. also allowed). This time I'm going to organize it by subject material.

### LGBTQ+

* [Prayer for Transformation](https://opensiddur.org/prayers/civic-calendar/international/transgender-day-of-visibility/prayer-of-kalonymus-from-sefer-even-bohan-1322/), a lament at being born male, by a trans woman named Rabbi Kalonymus, written in 1322. Both eloquent and relatable to a modern trans person. We've always been here.

### Fiction

* [Always Human](https://m.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557&page=1&webtoon-platform-redirect=true), a futuristic science fiction romance story. It's beautiful and touching and gentle and warm, and every page has it's own atmospheric music.
