I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been eleven months since I started, so here is the eleventh batch of photos.
These were (mostly) taken at Crystal Lake Park in Urbana, IL.
The coat is new (for me), I got it at a thrift store in town.
The first photo is from when I was trying it on.
