## Theory Poetry

Paper and guesswork,  
symbol and feeling.  
Mapping the ghostly,  
pattern to meaning.

Dredging through mudflow,  
pulling up crystal.  
Stretching for vapor,  
sculpting the mental.

"How can we show that",  
"What can we change in".  
"Why does it follow",  
"When have we proven".

Research has rhythm,  
thought into theorem.
