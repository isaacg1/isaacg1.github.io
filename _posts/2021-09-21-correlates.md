When I ask myself
"What's off today?
Why wasn't today particularly happy
or successful?",
there's actually a good answer, surprisingly often.
Here are some of the most common answers,
and some corresponding symptoms.

* Too long since last meal:
Gnawing, distracting hunger,
felt in the pit of my stomach.
Brain fog/lack of focus.

* Too much food:
Sleepiness, bloatedness, not feeling tired.

* Being cold: Lack of focus, restlessness,
cold extremities, inc. fingers and feet.

* Not enough sleep:
Distraction, low motivation,
lack of breaking away from amusements.
Weight behind eyes.
In extreme cases, irritability,
snapping at people.

* Nagging doubts about a project:
Procrastination, avoidance,
Lack of breaking away from amusements.
Broken prioritization,
such as "staying up to do work"
which I avoid doing.
Self-punishment via work.

* Insufficiently valuing nontraditional work:
Spending a lot of time in meetings,
or thinking speculatively.
