For the upcoming Trans Day of Visibilty (March 31st), I wrote the following essay, to perhaps be read (or shouted) at an upcoming rally.

### Visibility

Transition is a story of visibility and invisibility for me.

When I was a kid, I was an egg. I wanted to be friends with girls my age, I wanted to look like girls my age.

But I didn't have a name for that, didn't have a concept.

We were invisible to me.

And the story I was told was that I was a straight boy.

That I wanted to be close to girls because I was attracted to them.

That I admired how they looked because I was attracted to them.

That story prevented me from seeing myself. Made me invisible to myself.

I learned that I was wrong, that my feelings were wrong, that I was ogling my peers, that I was an aggressive male boy.

So I only explored who I am, who I was, who I wanted to be, when I was alone. When I was in secret. When I was invisible. That was when I was safe.

But I did explore. I didn't find affirmation, not really. I didn't find myself. But I found some confused people like me. And that was something.

When I became an adult, I could explore more. I still didn't know myself, but I had places I was safe. I could be a little more visible. Affirming clothing, even if I didn't know to call it that.

I met people who were queer, people who were trans. I didn't see myself in them, not yet. But we became a little more visible to me. A little more real.

I started going to an LGBTQ group, playing D&D and laying on beanbags and talking about experiences.

I told people I didn't feel straight, and they asked if I was bi. But no, I was only attracted to women.

I knew there were trans women, I knew that concept had some resonance to me. But that's not quite me, not quite who I am. Not close enough for me to see myself.

And then, finally, I had met enough people, seen enough people, enough visibility, that I could finally ask: Am I nonbinary? Is this me?

And the answer was, of course. Of course it's me.

Being real, being possible, that was what I needed.

Once I knew we exist, I could live. I could make it happen. I could try.

But I was still hiding. I still didn't really know myself.

But I knew where to look.

On the internet, through COVID. Exploring in ernest, reading, learning. Theorizing, analyzing myself, believing myself.

Affirming myself.

Eventually, I got breast forms and electrolysis affirming clothes and they pronouns and a name.

I was unfolding, flowering, coming into the light.

There was still a major sticking point, a major uncertainty.

Should I go on HRT?

To me, that was something women did. There were two kinds of trans people, I thought: nonbinary people, who don't want HRT, and binary trans people, who do.

It was all wrapped up in the difficulty in feeling secure in being nonbinary and not a binary person, a concept that society didn't understand, and doesn't understand.

Still not visible enough.

And then, I met someone. The first nonbinary person on HRT I'd ever met. March 2023.

And suddenly, we were visible. Suddenly, we were real. Suddenly, it was obvious.

So I did my research and collected more testimonies and came to terms with myself, and understood myself.

And the next month, April 2023, I went to the informed consent clinic, got my blood tested, confirmed I knew what I was getting, and started HRT.

And since then it's been more and more and more. More friends, more knowledge, more visibility.

Now, I'm not just benefitting from visibiilty, I'm being visible myself.

There's dozens, hundreds of people for whom I'm the first trans people they meet. I'm a teacher, visible to my students. I'm a researcher, visible at talks and conferences. And I'm in Industrial Engineering a field with very few trans people.

Not every trans people wants to be visible. Not every trans person has the option to be safely visible.

But I want to be visible, and I'm in the right spot for it.

I want to be loud and bright and unashamed. I want to tell everyone who wants to hear who I am and how I feel and what I want.

I'll walk across the city in a dress and thigh highs late into the night. The world belongs to me, I do not cower in fear.

I named my own gender: Ulzilna. It has a multitude of meanings, but an important one is taking joy in glittering, in shining, in flowering.

Visibility is wrapped up in my gender, inextricable from my self.

And I am visible for the next kid like me. So they don't have to suffer, alone and invisible.

We're building a different world.

Solidarity forever, we'll always be trans!
