I like picking up little bits of metal
that I find while out and about.
I've formed a collection,
which you can see here.
Note that this is only what
I've collected in the last few months.
I have more elsewhere, and when I was
younger I just held onto things for a
bit, then recycled or discarded them.

While I was out and about today (I like to blog while walking), I found several more pieces to add to my collection:

I particularly like the blue-tape-wrapped object which looks like a motor. Quite a unique find!

### Why I like it

I think I like finding bits of broken or discarded metal because metal is so permanent, and so indelibly marked by civilization.
