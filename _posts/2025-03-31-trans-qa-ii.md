title: '2nd Annual Trans Q&A for TDoV'
layout: post
---

Today is Trans Day of Visibility (TDoV)!
Every year, we celebrate trans people,
and make sure that everyone knows we're here,
we're not going anywhere,
and that there's work that we need to do to ensure that society supports trans people.

TDoV, every March 31st, is one of the two major annual trans days of recognition,
alongside Transgender Day of Remembrance, November 20th,
on which we mourn trans people who have been murdered for being trans.

I believe that visibility has power.
I think that the more our stories are out there,
the more that people who could be trans,
would benefit from being trans,
can see themselves represented, see themselves in us.
It took me a long time to see myself,
but I did.
I am grateful for everyone whose stories got me here.
That is why I want to be visible now.

For the second year,
I [solicited questions](/2025/03/05/trans-questions-ii) about being trans and nonbinary.
I'm answering these questions from my personal experience and perspective,
which I described in my question post.
Thank you to everyone who asked a question!

I plan to do Q&As like this each year, just like [last year](/2024/03/31/trans-qa).
I'll build up a catalog.

I'm answering these questions in the order they came in.

## Q1: Common Mistakes from Misunderstanding

> What are common mistakes (when trying to respect trans but have a certain misunderstanding) that others make when referring to trans people?

I'll go through three common mistakes, where they're coming from, and suggestions for change.
And I want to clarify that mistakes are a normal part of learning,
they're not exceptional and they don't mean you're a bad person.

### Mistake 1: Learning what works for one person and then emphatically treating everyone that way, without being open to different people being different.

There are a lot of ways of referring to people, and a lot of them are pretty individual.
There are terms that some people really like, and others really don't.
I describe myself as queer and gay and an enby,
and I know of people who don't like those terms at all.
I know people who like to refer to themselves with terms like
folx and transwoman and transsexual,
and people who can't stand them.
And all of these people are valid and good and wonderful.

If you don't know how to refer to someone, there's no expectation to know any of these preferences.
But it's important to be open to feedback, and open to change.

### Mistake 2: Difficulty handling being told you've made a mistake 

When you're learning how to refer to trans people,
making mistakes is pretty common.
For instance, you might mess up someone's pronouns.
I certainly messed up time and time again in my learning journey.
Furthermore, it's pretty common to not even notice that you've made a mistake.
Often, the only time you'll notice that you've made a mistake is when someone else lets you know
-- often, the person you've misgendered.

When people are told they've misgendered someone,
they often don't know how to handle this information.
For instance, people often go into a spiel about how they try really hard
to get the person's pronouns right, and they only messed it up this one time,
and that there are special circumstances for why it wasn't so bad,
and be really distraught about having gotten it wrong.
Often, this will escalate until the person who was misgendered
comforts the person who did the misgendering, and tells them it wasn't so bad,
suppressing their actual feelings in the process.

To handle this situation better, here are a few things to remember:

1. When someone tells you that you've misgendered them,
they're doing you a favor.
They could've just kept it to themself and given up on the possibility of you changing.
Instead, they're trying to help you learn, with the mutual trust that you're trying to learn.
You can repay that the trust and that favor with something simple like "Oh, sorry, thanks for telling me", and carry that desire to learn forward.

2. When someone tells you that you've misgendered them,
it's rarely the first time you've done it.
It's hard to work up that courage,
and so people often only point it out when it's a pattern.
They'll notice long before you will.
This makes "it was only this one time" ring particularly hollow.

3. Being told you've misgendered someone can feel like a threat to your self image.
You might think "I'm a good ally, I don't misgender people".
This is not true. Allies misgender people. Trans people misgender other trans people.
If someone thinks they never misgender anyone, it's either because they're thinking careful each time they use a gendered term to refer to someone,
or because they're completely unconscious of their pronoun usage
and never notice that they misgender anyone.
If your sense of goodness is wounded by being told you've misgendered someone,
that's Ok, your feelings are valid,
but the person you just misgendered is not a great person to go to for support in that moment.

### Mistake 3: When interacting with nonbinary people, treating us like we're gonna realize we're binary trans people any day now.

By "nonbinary people", I mean people who are not either a man or a woman, not a boy or a girl, and by binary trans people I mean trans men, trans women, trans boys, trans girls.

A lot of people who are trying to be supportive end up treating nonbinary people like binary trans people. Hearing that someone's taking T and wants a beard and using he/him for them. Hearing that someone likes dresses and pink and assuming they want to be called "girl" or "lady".

I am not a woman. I am nonbinary. I am not going to be a woman, I am not a woman-lite or woman-adjacent or any of that crap.

Some people try to justify this misgendering by bringing up that a lot of binary trans people have described themselves as nonbinary at some point in the past, for a variety of reasons.

This is bullshit. You can't predict whether someone will change how they describe themself at some point in the future, and you have no right to misgender someone. My nonbinariness is permanent, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not a waypoint, and don't you dare try to treat me otherwise.

Plenty of nonbinary people have described themselves as binary trans people at some point in the past, for a variety of reasons. It doesn't invalidate binary trans people's identities, and it doesn't justify misgendering.

## Q2: Moving to the next phase

> What kept you from "moving to the next phase" (questioning->exploration->crack->transition)? I know the Brainworms and Visibility posts do partially explain some of that.

I'll explore each of these phases in turn. In my case, I'd identify the phases as propensity (0-13), desire (13-18), exploration (18-24), hatched (24-26), out (26-30).

### Desire to Exploration

I started wishing I was trans around ages 13-15,
and I started exploring beyond complete secrecy at around age 18.

I didn't really have a "questioning" phase so much as a "desire" phase.
I wanted my gender to be different, my body to be different.
I had no hope it actually would happen, no possibility of that desire being actualized.

The primary reason for this delay was shame,
and specifically entwining sexuality and gender and shame.

I wished I looked like other people,
and wished I could dress like other people,
and wished I could be like other people.
Specifically the girls around my age in my school.
And I interpreted my intense interest and desire as sexual desire,
saw myself in the same pattern that I saw a lot of boys my age engaging in.
Unsolicited sexual advances or comments.
And I wanted nothing to do with that pattern, I didn't want to be that sort of person.

There were other darker effects of that conflation, which I've discussed elsewhere.

But the upshot is, I didn't understand my desire.
I didn't recognize myself.

And I didn't know any out queer people.

So I didn't go to my school's GSA, didn't read up on trans people, didn't talk with family members.
I just hid.

### Exploration to Crack

When I went to college at 18, I started exploring my gender. 
I didn't hatch until I was 24, two years into grad school.

In undergrad, I was drawn to queer spaces, but I never really opened up to anyone about my experiences. I had a lot of deep conversations, but not about this. I bought a good amount of women's clothing, but I didn't go shopping with anyone. I never went to a meetup group, never shared my feelings.

I didn't see myself in the trans people I met. They knew who they were and I didn't. And I didn't know how to handle myself around them, and didn't engage beyond some passing acquaintanceships.

And for the last two years of my undergrad, I was in a relationship with a straight woman.
And not just a straight woman, but a woman who specifically wanted me to be straight.
I didn't know who I was and she knew who she wanted me to be, and I conformed.
The last masculine haircut I ever got was because she asked me to,
because she found it more attractive.
I deeply regret dating her.

Once I went to graduate school, I decided I was going to go to the LGBTQ club on campus,
then called "Allies", now called "Prism".
The club had many smaller subgroups, called "support groups",
and the one that really helped me was the Dungeons and Dragons support group.
That was the first place where I could not just explore by gender
but explore it with people who weren't going to judge me.
That's also where I came to understand nonbinariness, and where I started meeting nonbinary people.
That was the turning point.

### Hatched to Out

When I was 24, I properly realized I was nonbinary. My egg phase ended, and I hatched.
But I didn't tell a ton of people.
I was in the process of drifting away from the club I mentioned,
as I got more and more distant in age from the other people in the club, who were undergrads.

I didn't know many people who I wanted to be out to. So instead, I mostly learned about myself, discovered myself via the internet. Also, it was the height of COVID. But nonetheless, I didn't explore with queer people I knew in person. I was shy about this aspect of myself, best I can describe it.

When I had built up my analytical and theoretical self-understanding, and read thousands of egg memes and trans memes, then I was ready to be out, ready to interact with other people. Ready to be myself.

## Q3: Abstraction and Overthinking

> Do you feel like abstraction or overthinking have sometimes gotten in the way?

Intellectually, I know this must've happened at some point, sometime, somewhere.

But no. I love analysis and abstraction and overthinking.
They've been by my side, through and through.
It was when I fled from engaging with hard emotions,
from sitting with complicated feelings, that was what went poorly, what hurt me.
When I accepted society's narratives rather than building my own.

I feel like I have built myself, carved myself, named myself, actualized myself, to a great degree.
And other people were certainly an important aid in that process at times.
But analysis, and overanalysis, have always been critical components.

I think one situation where I got stuck in overthinking was thinking about HRT.
Before I knew I was nonbinary, I knew I wanted a body shape like many women tend to have.
I dimly knew that there was medical approaches for that.
But I was stuck in a spiral of thinking that those medical interventions were for women.
And being permanently uncertain about whether I was a woman.

Eventually, I hatched, and realized I am nonbinary.

And then much later, I saw enough representation to realized that estrogen
isn't just for women, nonbinary people can take it too and it doesn't make me a woman
to do so. That I am nonbinary and I can have any hormone system I want and there is no right answer,
there is only what I want and what I choose.

So in a way, I overthought it.
If I had just gone "I don't know who I am, but I know I want to look like that",
it might've been better.

But if I had sublimated myself into womanness, erased my enbyness, it would've been shit.
I needed that overthinking, at the end of the day.

This is not a recommendation, this is just who I am.
I overthink everything, and I love myself for it.

## Q4: Views on Masculinity

> Have your views on "masculinity" or "being a man" changed after you realized you weren't one?

They have. My experience of masculinity used to be very coerced, enforced,
a box that someone forced one into.
A set of expectations, a script that one fulfils or fails.
The more masculine people were, the less comfortable I was around them.
It was a very patriarchal view as well, 
centered around economic and physical power.
I didn't like my muscles because I didn't like what they said about me and how I related to people.
I hated being tall because I hated looming over people.
I was scared of getting angry because I was scared I'd shout at people,
loud enough my throat hurt, loud enough they were scared of me.

I don't feel those ways any more. I don't feel those expectations, those fears.

Now, I mostly see masculinity through the lens of people who choose masculinity,
seek masculinity, embrace masculinity.
Trans men, trans people of many kinds who choose to embrace some masculinity,
butch lesbians.
I see people overjoyed at their voices dropping,
and their facial hair growing.
I see people taking pride in building their muscles,
in the shapes of their bodies.

I see men who love to provide a steady, supportive emotional base
when people need to open up, need to be vulnerable.

I see people for whom masculinity is a key part of their true self.
And I see men.

And I am very gradually, very tenderly,
engaging with parts of myself that touch upon masculinity.
I enjoy carrying people.
I enjoy throwing rocks off cliffs.
I enjoy making an ultra-deep demonic growling noise.
I have soft little chest hair.
These are gendered, for me.
Masculine isn't how I'd describe these aspects of me,
but it's a term I can recognize in myself in these ways.
These are parts of what it means to be an [ulzilna](/2024/02/14/gender-identity#a-label-maker),
the name of my very own gender.
