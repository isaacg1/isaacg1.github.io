## Living in a postselected world

Suppose you see someone flip a coin five times, and get five heads. What's the chance that the next time they flip the coin, it's also heads?

Naive probability would say one half, by assuming it's a fair coin. In the real world, it's a little more than a half: it might be an unfair coin, a party trick, or something like that.

But there's another question to consider, even if the coin is totally fair and no tricks are pulled: *Why are you watching this coin be flipped?* If you're watching the coin be flipped live in front of you, it's no big deal. But if you're watching a video you found on the internet, you're way more likely to see the next coin come up heads.

This is **postselection**: The reason you're watching this video is probably because there's a long streak of heads flipped in this video. This isn't just any video, it's a video of someone flipping a lot of heads. This isn't just any coin, it's a coin that's going to flip heads.

The degree of postselection, the amount of bias towards something impressive happening, is based on how filtered your viewing environment is. The real world, and live events, are essentially unfiltered. If the coin flipping video is made by a friend or someone you know, it's probably only moderately filtered: it would only take a somewhat impressive occurrence to bring the video to your attention.

But if the coin flipping video is just out there on the general internet, a stupendous amount of filtering has happened to bring this video to your attention. Out of millions of people flipping millions of coins, you're watching this one. As a result, one-in-a-million coincidences, like flipping 20 heads in a row, are commonplace.

## Implications of Postselection

Now, instead of coin-flipping, you see a very offensive tweet that someone sent. You want to figure out if the tweet is reflective of the sender's inherent nature (i.e. they're an awful person) or not reflective (i.e. a failed joke, a typo, out of context, etc.).

This question closely parallels the coin flipping question. If we see a coin flipped heads twenty times, do we lean towards a plugged coin (inherent nature) or random chance (not inherent nature).

To answer this question, we must examine the level of postselection that has occurred in bringing the offensive tweet to our attention.
