title: 'Transition photos: Month 24'
layout: post
---

I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twenty-four months (two years!) since I started.
Special for this post, I have a transition timeline!
The first photo is from May 2022, and the rest cover each month since starting E.
All photos are as dynamic and unique as I could find.

These were taken on the Northwestern University campus in Evanston, IL.
