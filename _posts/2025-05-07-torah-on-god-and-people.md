Let's talk about the Torah, and what it says about
God's moral decisions,
and moral discussions between God and people.

To give an idea of where I am coming from,
I am culturally Jewish, and an atheist.
I think that God is a fictional character,
as are Abraham, Moses, Aaron,
and the other characters that I'll discuss.

I want to talk about God's moral decision making because
God is often portrayed the source of all goodness,
and morally perfect,
especially in the Christian tradition.
This portrayal is used to justify ultimate authority:
The word of God must never be questioned,
a person can never know better than God.
This authority is in turn used to justify the authority of religious figures:
One's priest speaks with the backing of God, and so must never be questioned,
a congregant can never know better than them.

In the Jewish tradition, in the Torah,
I believe that God is not portrayed as morally perfect.
Instead, the Torah repeatedly portrays God
as overly vengeful towards groups of people who have angered them.
This vengeance can only be quelled via discussion with mortal people,
demonstrating that God alone is not the final moral authority.

I want to focus in particular on three passages in the Torah that touch upon
the morality of God:
* [Genesis 18:23-18:33](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/text/vayeira):
    Abraham negotiates with God to be more open to sparing Sodom and Gomorrah,
    if innocent people are found living there.
* [Numbers 17:6-17:15](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/text/korach):
    God wants to annihilate the entire Jewish community via a plague.
    Moses and Aaron defy God's command and pray for the community.
    God relents, ending the plague after killing "only" 14,700 Jews.
* [Exodus 10:1-13:16](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/text/bo):
    The Ten Plagues.
    God intentionally hardens Pharoh's heart,
    preventing him from letting the Jews leave,
    because they want a reason to display their marvels,
    so that future generations will be impressed by them.
    Moses, the one person in conversation with God,
    offers no pushback, going along with everything God says.
    God escalates and escalates in vengeance until they kill every firstborn Egyptian.
    This is the mass slaughter of innocents,
    one of the most fundamentally immoral acts in existence.
    Moreover, there is no necessity to this action:
    God could simply have not hardened Pharoh's heart. <br>
    In this passage, I argue that Moses acts as an enabler.
    He conceals God's choice to harden Pharoh's heart from the wider community.
    Because no person argued God down from their vengeance,
    their vengeance was unchecked and wildly extreme.

I will be using the translation found in "The Torah: A Modern Commentary, Revised Edition",
edited by Rabbi W. Gunther Plaut, linked above.

I believe that with a full reading, in context,
these passages depict the necessity for people to argue with God,
disobey God,
and pull God back from their most violent plans.
God is not the source of all goodness:
Their goodness requires people to check their impulses.

Because the Torah is an ancient document
written in a language very different from English, translation is difficult,
and we must be careful to not make assumptions about what certain words mean.
I decided to use a translation based on the Jewish tradition,
rather than the Christian tradition,
as I think it more closely tracks the underlying Hebrew.
I will seek to illuminate the context in which these passages occur,
in order to better understand what the text means.
