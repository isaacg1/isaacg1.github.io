I am taking estrogen HRT, and I'll be documenting and celebrating
how my appearance changes by taking photos every month.
It's been twelve months (one year!) since I started.
Special for this post, I have a transition timeline!
I hatched five years ago, in 2019, and the photos run from pre-hatching to the present:

And now, for the standard twelfth batch of photos.
These were taken around Urbana, IL and Champaign, IL.
